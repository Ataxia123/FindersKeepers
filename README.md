-> What does Finders Keepers do?

 Aggregate Zora finder's fee's by creating a platform to discover NFTs. Listings at Finder's Keepers marketplace create Lens posts that spread the word about the art being listed by being shared by the DAO. The dao is incentivized to generate a sale and keep the finder's fee to fund operations + growth.
